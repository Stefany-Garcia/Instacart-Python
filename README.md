# Instacart-Python
This is a project completed for the Career Foundry Data Analytics Program. 

## Background
Instacart wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns, specifically the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and theyâ€™re considering a targeted marketing strategy.

## Objective
Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis. The goal is  to derive insights and inform Instacart's marketing strategy by ensuring Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

## Data
Data used includes an open source dataset from 2017 provided by Instacart and a customer data set created by Career Foundry for the purpose of this project.
